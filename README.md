# Skin Cancer Detection

This project was carried out with VÃ­ctor Cereijo as part of a course in Computer Vision.

Thanks to the pattern recognition capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks, skin cancer can nowadays be early detected by visually analyzing the characteristic of a skin mole. In this notebook we propose a skin cancer detection algorithm with CNNs, comparing the performance of a network trained from scratch with one pretrained on Imagenet. 

We used ISIC DB 2018 dataset to evaluate the experiments, a highly imbalanced dataset containing 2750 dermoscopic images, publicly available here: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data
