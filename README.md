# Skin Cancer Detection

Thanks to the pattern recognition capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks, skin cancer can nowadays be early detected by visually analyzing the characteristic of a skin mole. In this notebook we propose a skin cancer detection algorithm based on some of the most typical CNN arquitectures (Resnet, Inception, MobileNet, DenseNet and a from scrath network) that performs binary image classification ('0': non-cancer, '1': cancer). 

We used ISIC DB 2018 dataset to evaluate the experiments. A highly imbalanced dataset containing 2750 dermoscopic images, publicly available here: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data
